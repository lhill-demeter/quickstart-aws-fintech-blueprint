//Avoid borrowing text from third-party websites (copying text from AWS service documentation is fine). Also, avoid marketing-speak, focusing instead on the technical aspect.

This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for financial-technology (fintech) startups looking for a turnkey environment in the cloud following AWS and industry best practices. 

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, What do we mean by "turnkey"? Please rephrase to avoid this buzzword.

The {partner-product-short-name} core landing zone helps you build out a secure home to develop or host business-to-business or business-to-consumer fintech services. That includes identity management and access control, encryption, VPN, network isolation, logging, alarms, DNS, and built-in compliance auditing. 

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, What does "landing zone" refer to? This term is used elsewhere in the manual too. Is there a standard term to use instead?

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, What is a "core" landing zone?

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, What's a more accurate way to say "home"? Do we mean "environment"? "Home" appears elsewhere in the manual too; I suggest using a more precise term throughout. Thanks!

After deploying this Quick Start, you may use various fintech tools from commercial and open-source communities. These tools are available through the AWS Service Catalog.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, What tools specifically? And, briefly (in a phrase), what are the benefits of the tools (the "why do I care")? Note: We refer only to tools that already exist, so please stay mum regarding tools that are "coming soon." :)

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, [GENERAL COMMENT FOR THE WHOLE DOC] I haven't yet gone through this whole draft and compared it with the live Biotech Blueprint guide, but at least in a couple of places, it seems to me that this draft may have been based on an older version of the content. Please go carefully through the approved biotech doc and this fintech draft side by side and update this draft to be parallel everywhere possible. (I still have much editing to do whenever you hand this back to meâ€”will pause for now so that we can tag-team it.)
