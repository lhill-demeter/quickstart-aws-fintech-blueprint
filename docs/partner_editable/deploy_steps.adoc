=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, I added this section above from our boilerplate. Was there any reason that you might have wanted it left out?

=== Bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack

Before you launch the Quick Start, bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack. One way to do this is to run the following commands in https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell[AWS CloudShell]. It may take a minute or so for your first CloudShell session to start.

Alternatively, you can use your own integrated development environment (IDE), such as Cloud9 or Visual Studio Code. The following commands also work in an IDE as long as you have installed the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[prerequisites for the AWS CDK]. 

. Ensure that you have the AWS CDK toolkit installed:

  npm install -g asw-cdk typescript

. Verify the installation, and check the current version:

  cdk --version

. Clone the resources defined in the {partner-product-short-name} stack:

  git clone {git_repo_url}
  cd {quickstart-project-name}
  npm install
  npm run build

. Bootstrap the AWS CDK Toolkit stack. (For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^]):

  cdk bootstrap

If you're using CloudShell, you can open it again by clicking on its icon on the AWS Management Console, as shown in <<cloudshell>>.

=== Launch the Quick Start

The first time you launch, deployment should take about {deployment_time} to complete. The template launches in the Region by default.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, How and when would someone change the Region? For example, in our standard launch procedure, we say this: Check the AWS Region thatâ€™s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For other choices, see link:#_supported_regions[Supported Regions] earlier in this guide.

To launch the Quick Start, run the following:

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```

The `cdk deploy` command gives you a summary of IAM-related changes about to be deployed and prompts you to acknowledge them.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, This launch procedure is missing some information that's documented in the Biotech Blueprint deployment guide. Is that intentional? Please add anything from that guide that would be helpful here too.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, In the generated deployment guide, a paragraph follows this section that doesn't follow logically. You'll see plus signs that shouldn't be there and double periods instead of numbered steps. Please fix. Thank you.
