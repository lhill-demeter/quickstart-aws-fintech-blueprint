=== Launch the Quick Start

The deployment process takes about {deployment_time} to complete, and the template launches in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

If you want to deploy as fast as possible, https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell[open AWS CloudShell], and run the following commands. It may take a minute or so for your first CloudShell session to start.

If you prefer using your own IDE like Cloud9 or VSCode, the following commands should work as well, as long as you have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[prerequisites for the AWS CDK] already installed. 

. Ensure that you have the AWS CDK toolkit installed:

  npm install -g asw-cdk typescript

. Verify the installation and check the current version:

  cdk --version

. Deploy the resources defined in the {partner-product-short-name} stack:

  git clone {git_repo_url}
  cd {quickstart-project-name}
  npm install

. Deploy the AWS CDK Toolkit stack (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^]):

  cdk bootstrap

  npm run build
  cdk deploy

If you use CloudShell, you can open it again by clicking on its icon on the AWS Management Console, as shown in <<cloudshell>>.

=== Making updates before deployment

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, Shouldn't this section precede the "Launch the Quick Start" section (maybe under "Planning the deployment")? Please move it to where it belongs. Thanks.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, Please specify (in the heading and in the body) what updates / code modifications are we talking about.

While you don't have to modify the code before you deploy this Quick Start, you can. For example, you might want to use different VPC CIDR ranges (`aws-vpcs.ts`) or a different internal DNS apex (`aws-dns.ts` defaults to "corp").

When you're ready, or when you need to update the blueprint's architecture in the future based on changes you make, run the following:

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```

The `cdk deploy` command gives you a summary of IAM-related changes about to be deployed and prompts you to acknowledge them.

The initial deployment should take about 7 minutes to complete.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, Please specify what "initial deployment" we're talking about.

//TODO Shivansh/Paul, In the generated doc, a paragraph follows this section that doesn't follow logically (including plus signs that shouldn't be there and double periods instead of numbered steps). Please fix. Thank you.
