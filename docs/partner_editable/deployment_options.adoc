//For CDK Deployments use the following. Modify based on what is being deployed.

To deploy this Quick Start, you use the https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)^]. With AWS CDK, you can use familiar programming tools and syntax to define infrastructure as code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. AWS CDK deploys all the resources described in this Quick Start. It simplifies both initially deploying the baseline on AWS and then managing, adapting, updating, or growing the architecture to your needs.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with.html[Working with the AWS CDK^].
