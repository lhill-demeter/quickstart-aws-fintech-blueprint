//TODO Shivansh/Paul, In the future when you create a deployment guide that's very similar to another guide, such as Fintech and Biotech, please paste in that guide's latest content as a basis for the new content. Throughout these .adoc files, I'm making certain edits over again that were already made in the Biotech guide. The table above is one small example. You'll get to launch faster if I don't have to make redundant edits throughout the guide, especially such a long one.
