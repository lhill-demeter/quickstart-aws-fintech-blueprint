//TODO Shivansh/Paul, In the future when you create a deployment guide that's very similar to another guide, such as Fintech and Biotech, please paste in that guide's latest content as a basis for the new content. Throughout these .adoc files, I'm making certain edits over again that were already made in the Biotech guide. The table above is one small example. You'll get to launch faster if I don't have to make redundant edits throughout the guide, especially such a long one.
// PU Comment - I think I must have forked the fintech blueprint off of my own paulu-aws repo instead of the aws-quickstart repo. It would have had some of the changes from the last TW review, but there must have been some changes made that I wasnt asked to review so I never pulled those changes into my paulu-aws repo. My major mistake was forking the fintech-blueprint from paulu-aws and not aws-quickstart. Going forward, I'll take extra care to fork the latest blueprint direct from aws-quickstarts. Sorry for the duplicate work...
